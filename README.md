A cli-tool to clean your signal backup folder. This is only useful if you move your backups off your android device and keep multiple copies.

## Features

- **Dynamic Retention Control** You choose how many months are kept fully or partial
- **Statistics** Show you how much storage you save by purging old backups!
- **Easy to use** Simple rules make it easy to predict what is kept!

## Installation

```sh
# java needs to be configured in the PATH-variable
java -jar Signal-Backup-Purge.jar -h
```


## Usage
